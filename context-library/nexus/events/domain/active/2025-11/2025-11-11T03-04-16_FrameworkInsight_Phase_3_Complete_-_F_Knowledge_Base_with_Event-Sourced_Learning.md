Successfully implemented Phase 3 adding event-sourced learning system. New capabilities: LearningEventType (9 types), learning event writer, knowledge projections (patterns.md, error-solutions.md, confidence-scores.yaml), and 3 new MCP tools (record_learning, lookup_pattern, lookup_error_solution). Bootstrapped with 4 learning events from Phase 2/3 experience documenting FS3373 solutions and interpolated string patterns. The system now learns from every coding session and builds persistent F# knowledge across conversations.
